# Other-Scripts
All these scripts were designed with the idea of deploying them via Jamf MDM. Most can be run locally or with another MDM. Some will require SwiftDialog, JamfHelper, or AppleScript.
<br />
<br />
I believe tools/scripts should be shared to the community, even more so for the Mac Admin community. Many of the scripts below are pulled from other various public scripts with my needed tweaks. So feel free to tweak/use them.

If you have questions or ideas reach out to me on the Mac Admins Slack channel or if you work with me find me on teams, cocopuff2u
